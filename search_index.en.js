And it was mainly in maintenance mode. \nBut lately I have been working on Gill, an activity pub based git platform. \nIt's not ready for production yet, but it is already a big project with a dozen crates in the cargo workspace. \nUnfortunately I was not able to use Cocogitto for this project because of its mono-repository nature. \nThe least I could do for a project so closely related to git is to correctly manage versioning, so finally \ndecided to tackle mono-repo support in Cocogitto. \nGlobal version\nWithout further ado here is a sample of the first repository changelog generated by Cocogitto:\n\nAs you can see the automatic bump performed by Cocogitto\ngenerated a global changelog and created a tag for each updated crate on the workspace. \nThere were no previous tag on the repository so a new version was created for each crate. Subsequent bumps will \ngenerate a new version only for crates modified since the previous release. \nThe mono-repository bump also generate a global project tag. It's calculated based on the generated package tags \nor on the global commits. \nPer package version\nThe bump also generated a new changelog for each updated crate: \n\nHow to\nMono-repo support is just a matter of configuration. \nIf you have used Cocogitto before, all you need to do is to update your cog.toml to declare your monorepo packages. \nHere is a sample of Gill's configuration\npre_bump_hooks = [\n\"SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo test\",\n\"SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo clippy\",\n\"cargo fmt --all\",\n\"SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo build --release\",\n]\n\npost_bump_hooks = [\n\"git push\",\n\"git push origin --tags\",\n]\n\npre_package_bump_hooks = [\n\"cargo set-version {{version}}\"\n]\n\n[packages]\ngill-app = { path = \"crates/gill-app\" }\ngill-authorize-derive = { path = \"crates/gill-authorize-derive\", public_api = false }\ngill-db = { path = \"crates/gill-db\", public_api = false }\ngill-git = { path = \"crates/gill-git\", public_api = false }\ngill-git-server = { path = \"crates/gill-git-server\" }\ngill-markdown = { path = \"crates/gill-markdown\", public_api = false }\ngill-settings = { path = \"crates/gill-settings\" }\ngill-syntax = { path = \"crates/gill-syntax\" }\ngill-web-markdown = { path = \"crates/gill-web-markdown\" }\nsyntect-plugin = { path = \"crates/syntect-plugin\", public_api = false }\n\nDifferences with standard bump\n\nRun per package hooks with are define using pre_package_bump_hooks, post_package_bump_hooks. \nPackage hooks run with the package path as current directory.\nThey can be overridden per package. For instance if all packages are build with cargo except for a npm frontend. \nyou just need to override the hooks for that package. \npackage declared with public_api = false will be bumped but will not affect the calculated global version. \n\n","id":"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/cocogitto-monorepository/","title":"Announcing Cocogitto 5.3.0"},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/how-to-lapce-plugin/":{"body":"This has been asked a lot on the Lapce Discord server so I am going to write a small guide \non how to write a Lapce LSP plugin. \nCurrent state of the plugin ecosystem\nLapce plugin system allow you to create a wasm binary which will be responsible for starting a LSP \nserver implementation and dispatch message between Lapce and the LSP server. \nThe Language Server Protocol provides language related features such as autocompletion, \nrefactors, code actions etc. \nCurrently, communication with a LSP implementation is the only feature avalaible through Lapce plugins.\nThat said, there are ongoing works to provide a LSP superset called Plugin Server Protocol (PSP).\nThe goal of PSP is to provide a general abstraction for editor related actions like: launching commands, \nhandling settings, drawing plugin UI etc.\nPlugin architechure\nBefore actually writting a plugin let's review quickly how plugins work under the hood. \nFirst you can get a global view of the plugin architecture on\nLapce official documentation. \nNow that you are familiar  with the general architechure let's zoom a bit on LSP plugins. \nPlugin lifecycle roughly goes like this :\n\nLapce starts plugins depending on the current editor file extension. \nThe plugin determine if it needs to download the LSP server implementation. For instance on first launch, \nThe rust plugin will download rust-analyzer. Once installed the plugin launch\nthe LSP server.\nUser action in Lapce (ex: typing) will trigger some events, those events will forwarded Lapce proxy, which will \ntranslate those event into LSP request if needed (for instance completion requests).\nThe LSP plugin respond via stdout, Lapce proxy translate the LSP response into UI changes. \nSo on and so forth.\n\nThis might seems a lot, but fortunatly for us the lapce-plugin crate does all the heavy lifting for us. \nAll we need to do is to provide some plugin settings to lapce and write the LSP implementation installation \nand startup logic. \nGetting started\nLapce plugin can be written in any language that compiles to wasm architecture, but for the sake of simplicity\nwe are going to use Rust with the lapce-plugin crate. \nBefore diving into the actual coding we need to pick a LSP implementation. You probably came here with a \nspecific language in mind, to find if there is an LSP implementation available for your language, check \nthe LSP implemenation list. \nFor this tutorial we are going to implement Java support via Eclipse JDTLS. \nPrerequisite\n\nRust\nLapce\nLSP implementation specifics (For instance here Java)\nA Github account\n\nVolt template\nInternally Lapce plugins are called \"volts\", I was told that Lapce creator Dongdong Zhou came up with \"volt\" \nbecause Lapce is Lightning Fast 🙂.\nThe lapce-community github org host various plugin and also \nprovide a template repository to create plugins using Rust.\nTo get started open lapce-community/lapce-volt-template\nand click the \"Use this template\" button on the repository page. This will create a new repo for your plugin.\nYou will need to give your repository a name, we are going to name ours lapce-java. \nOnce you are done clone your repository and open it in Lapce.\nSetting up the environment\nWhen listed on the official plugin list you can install Lapce plugins\nfrom the UI. Since we are developping a new plugin we will need to install it manually to test it. \nTo install a plugin you need to copy the relevant file to Lapce plugin directory (on linux $HOME/.local/share/lapce-stable/plugins) \nBuild script\nI personnally like the simplicity of justfiles so I went for a simple\njust script: \nxdg_data_dir :=  \"$HOME/.local/share\"\nplugin_dir := \"plugins/oknozor.lapce-java\"\n\nbuild:\n    cargo make\n\ninstall-stable: build\n    mkdir -p {{xdg_data_dir}}/lapce-stable/{{plugin_dir}}/bin\n    yes | cp -i bin/lapce-java.wasm {{xdg_data_dir}}/lapce-stable/{{plugin_dir}}/bin\n    yes | cp -i volt.toml {{xdg_data_dir}}/lapce-stable/{{plugin_dir}}/\n    rm -rd {{xdg_data_dir}}/lapce-stable/{{plugin_dir}}/jdt-language-server-latest || true\n\nTo install the plugin you can now run just install stable. If you don't want to use just a simple shell script can do the exact same thing. \nI strongly advise to install the plugin after each step and launch a java project in Lapce to track your progress.\nDebugging\nAlong the tutorial you might want to debug your plugin, emit log etc. \nHere are the few things you can do to get some informations :\n\n\nPlugin stderr\nYou can start lapce in the terminal to inspect plugin log emitted through sdterr. Note that these logs are not emitted with eprintln! macro but using lapce_plugin::PLUGIN_RPC.stderr: \nPLUGIN_RPC.stderr(&amp;format!(\"Oh no!\"));\n\n\n\nLapce logs\nLSP error will be forwarded to Lapce log file, you can inspect log via lapce pallete commands &gt;Open Log File \nand &gt;Open Log Directory\n\n\nChanging the plugin metadata\nFor the plugin to be able to declare itself to Lapce we need to edit \nvolt.toml and Cargo.toml to replace the template plugin name with the correct name. \n\n\nCargo.toml\n[package]\nedition = \"2021\"\nname = \"lapce-java\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\n\n\n\nvolt.toml\n# volt.toml\nname = \"lapce-java\"\nversion = \"0.2.0\"\n\nauthor = \"Paul Delafosse &lt;paul.delfafosse@gmail.com&gt;\"\ndisplay-name = \"Java\"\n\ndescription = \"Lapce LSP plugin for java, powered by Eclipse JDT Language Server\"\nwasm = \"bin/lapce-java.wasm\"\n\n[activation]\nlanguage = [\"java\"]\nworkspace-contains = [\"*/*.java\"]\n\n\n\nSee on github: 8a1a278\nImplementing the plugin\nWe are now ready to write the plugin logic. You would be surprise how little we actually have to code. \nFor our simple Java plugin, the only logic we need to edit resides in the initialize function. \nThis function is called by lapce when the \"activate\"  conditions are met (see volt.toml).\nDocument selectors\nFirst we need to setup the DocumentSelector which will tell Lapce if it should use the LSP server\nfor a given file extention or a language id: \n    let document_selector: DocumentSelector = vec![DocumentFilter {\n        language: Some(String::from(\"java\")),\n        pattern: Some(String::from(\"**/*.java\")),\n        scheme: None,\n    }];\n\nSee on github: 1482245\nDownload the LSP server\nWe need to download our lsp server implementation from eclipse.org. \n    // We are going to extract eclipse jdtls lsp server to this directory\n    let jdtls_file_name = \"jdt-language-server-latest\";\n    // This is the dowloaded tar archive name\n    let gz_path = PathBuf::from(format!(\"{jdtls_file_name}.tar.gz\"));\n    \n    // Url to the latest jdtsl server archive\n    let url = format!(\n        \"http://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/{}.tar.gz\",\n        jdtls_file_name\n    );\n\n    // If the path does not exists yet we need to download and or extract the server archive\n    if !PathBuf::from(jdtls_file_name).exists() {\n        // if the tarball does not exist, retrieve it from eclipse.org\n        if !gz_path.exists() {\n            let mut resp = Http::get(&amp;url)?;\n            let body = resp.body_read_all()?;\n            std::fs::write(&amp;gz_path, body)?;\n        }\n\n        // Extract the tarball to \"jdt-language-server-latest\"\n        let tar_gz = std::fs::File::open(gz_path).unwrap();\n        let tar = MultiGzDecoder::new(tar_gz);\n        let mut archive = tar::Archive::new(tar);\n        let dir = PathBuf::from(jdtls_file_name);\n        std::fs::create_dir(&amp;dir)?;\n        for (_, file) in archive.entries().unwrap().raw(true).enumerate() {\n            let mut entry = file?;\n            let entry_type = entry.header().entry_type();\n            if !entry_type.is_dir() &amp;&amp; !entry_type.is_file() {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            let entry_path = dir.join(&amp;entry.path()?);\n            if entry_type.is_dir() {\n                std::fs::create_dir_all(&amp;entry_path)?;\n            } else if entry_type.is_file() {\n                let mut outfile = File::create(&amp;entry_path)?;\n                std::io::copy(&amp;mut entry, &amp;mut outfile)?;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nSee on github: 5a44c14\nPlugin settings\nPlugins may expose settings through lapce UI. These could be specific configurations\nfor the LSP server, path to a custom LSP executable etc. \nFor instance the screenshot below illustrate the settings exposed by the Rust plugin.\n\nOne thing we definitely want to support in the Java LSP language server is lombok support. \nIt is widely used and lombok code generation is likely to emit tons of error if not supported by our LSP server. \nTo display the option in lapce UI we first need to add the setting to our volt.toml file: \n[config.\"lombok\"]\ndefault = false\ndescription = \"Enable the lombok java agent\"\n\nAnd then parse those param in the `initialize function: \n    let mut enable_lombok_agent = false;\n\n    if let Some(options) = params.initialization_options.as_ref() {\n        if let Some(enable_lombok) = options.get(\"lombok\") {\n            enable_lombok_agent = serde_json::from_value(enable_lombok.clone())?;\n        }\n    // ... etc\n    }\n\nThen we need to check on start if the lombok jar is present or else download it\nand add it to the lsp server parameters: \n    if enable_lombok_agent {\n        let lombok_jar = \"lombok.jar\";\n        let lombok_url = format!(\"https://projectlombok.org/downloads/{lombok_jar}\");\n\n        if !PathBuf::from(lombok_jar).exists() {\n            let mut resp = Http::get(&amp;lombok_url)?;\n            let body = resp.body_read_all()?;\n            std::fs::write(&amp;lombok_jar, body)?;\n        }\n\n        let lombok = base_path.join(\"lombok.jar\")?;\n        let lombok = lombok.to_file_path().expect(\"failed to get file path\");\n        let lombok = lombok.to_string_lossy();\n        server_args.push(format!(\"--jvm-arg=-javaagent:{lombok}\"));\n    }\n\nAnd that's it, lombok should work with the LSP server now!\nSee on github: 2a79531\nMaking a PR to Lapce plugin repository\nOnce you have tested your plugin and are happy with the result, you can publish it to Lapce\nby making a PR to lapce/lapce.github.io.\nSee on github: lapce.github.io/pull/39/files\nConclusion\nThat all for now, if you have suggestion to improve this article please submit a PR to oknozor/blog. \nYou can ask for help on Lapce's Discord server. \n","id":"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/how-to-lapce-plugin/","title":"How to write a Lapce LSP plugin"},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/one-click-away-from-release/":{"body":"My first encounter with the Conventional Commits\nspecification occurred during my internship a couple of year ago.\nWe were using the spec in most of our projects. \nHaving dealt before with commit logs polluted with meaningless commit messages such as \"test\", \"fix bug\", \nenforcing a commit convention to have a nice human-readable git history felt good. But I soon realised that\nwe were still missing the point.\nAt the time I was also learning Rust, so I started a hobby project called Cocogitto, \na cli to enforce and leverage the specification. \nToday I pleased to release Cocogitto 4.0.0 !\nIn this article I will take you through a quick tour of the project and show you how you can automate your SemVer Release with it. \nBut before that we need to talk a bit more about the specification itself.\nI will assume basic knowledge of both SemVer\nand Conventional Commits. If you have not read those specs yet\ngo read them now ! \nConventional Commits and SemVer\n\n\"This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.\"\n\nThis is probably the most important thing to know about Conventional Commits: it was designed to help you use SemVer.\nThere are other benefits to use the specification but these are just side effects in my opinion. \nHow does it work ?\nThe rule is quite simple actually , If your commit history since the latest tag contains at least one: \n\nbug fix commit, increment the PATCH version.\nfeature commit, the next version should increment the MINOR version number.\nbreaking change commit, increment the MAJOR version number.\n\nExample:\nLet's look at a chunk of commit history from Cocogitto. \nHere the current version is 3.0.0 in the example above we have a feat commit. If we create a version now\nit shall be 3.1.0. Dead simple, actually.\n* 16cf259 - (HEAD) docs: update readme\n* bb07f38 - chore: use MIT license in cargo.toml\n* d0a40b6 - ci: update codecov action\n* 916adb9 - chore: remove aur package submodule #141\n* 1d29e96 - feat(cli): improve commit format error format\n* b2ef3aa - fix(bump): fix target changelog tag on bump\n\nWhy do we need a commit message convention ?\nOk, I have just been rephrasing the spec at this point, but let us consider this:\n\nThe Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy \nset of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. \n\nIn other words, there is absolutely no good reason to use Conventional Commits (or any other convention)\nif you don't leverage the available tooling to automate repetitive tasks. This is what I meant when saying we were \nmissing the point. \nI have seen projects using Keep a Changelog\nwithout keeping a changelog, conventional Commits without Semver. There are also some crazy people out there\nusing emoji in commit messages.\nPlease don't do those things!\nConventional Commits \"makes it easier to write automated tools\" and luckily there are plenty.\nIf you are absolutely sure you don't need a changelog or semantic versioning, you will probably be better off writing\nclear and concise commit messages using natural language. \nOn the other hand if you do need automation, semantic versioning, \ngenerated changelogs and all the good stuff. You might want to use Conventional Commits with the proper tooling.\nIntroducing Cocogitto\nWhen working on a project with git you create commits locally, push them to a remote repository and package them via some\nCI/CI pipelines. \nThere is an implicit boundary between where the code is written (your machine) and where the code lives (anywhere else). \nCocogitto reflect that by being split in two distinct binaries : \n\ncoco which provides everything you need to create conventional commits.\ncog containing the tools needed to enforce and leverage the convention.\n\nBefore going further we will take a quick tour of the project capabilities.\nNote that this is just a quick intro, if you want an in depth guide you can check the official documentation.\nCreating conventional commits\ncoco as a set of subcommands matching the Conventional Commits and Angular commits types.\nYou can add new subcommands in a config file named cog.toml in your repository if needed. \nHow do I create a commit ?\ncoco feat \"implement parser specification\"\n# -&gt; 'feat: implement parser specification'\n\nWhat if we need a commit scope ? \ncoco feat \"implement parser specification\" parser\n# -&gt; 'feat(parser): implement parser specification'\n\nNote how the scope is provided after the message, it might seem unintuitive, but I decided I wanted as few flags as possible\nin the command line. \nOk, I want a breaking change commit now.\ncoco feat -B \"implement parser specification\"\n# -&gt; 'feat!(parser): implement parser specification'\n\nI need to write a conventional commit message with body and footers\ncoco feat -B -e \"implement parser specification\"\n# -&gt; 'feat!(parser): implement parser specification'\n\nThe -e flag will open an editor prefilled with the entered commit summary :\n\nWhat if I still make some mistakes ?\nIf you are an expert conventional committer, at this point you might think the CLI design still permit mistake regarding\nthe convention. Well if you happen to make a mistake coco will produce an error explaining why your message does not\nrespect the convention: \n\nNow that we took a quick tour of coco, let's take a look at cog which does all the heavy lifting.\nEnforcing the specification\nCreating conventional commits locally is fine but what if the other people working on the project do not use coco ?\nWhat if I am a clumsy committer and make mistake all the time ?\nThere are a multiple ways Cocogitto can help you with that: \n\nthe check subcommand to validate your commit log. \nthe install-hook subcommand to generate pre-push and commit-msg git-hooks.\ncocogitto-action run these checks on your CI\ncocogitto-bot check your PR and let your contributors know when they made a mistake.\n\nHow do I validate my commit history locally?\n\nHow do I install git-hooks ?\ncog install-hook pre-push\ncog install-hook pre-commit\n\nHow do I use this in my CI pipeline?\nCurrently, Cocogitto support GitHub action only, but I am planning to add Gitlab CI and Azure DevOps integration soon. \n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n    with:\n      fetch-depth: 0\n      \n  - name: Conventional Commits check\n    uses: cocogitto/cocogitto-action@main\n    with:\n      check-latest-tag-only: true\n\nA GitHub bot You said?\nCocogitto-bot will check every commit on your pull-request.\nIt is free of charge and will remain so for public open-source repository. So go ahead and try it ! \n\nThe one click release\nSo far I have been throwing examples and screenshots without giving much context.\nI hope you want to try Cocogitto already, but the interesting part actually starts here. \nCreating and validating commits is great, but not useful in itself. \nAs we saw earlier the purpose of the specification is to automate version increments and changelogs generation.\nThis is exactly what we are going to do know. \nIn a first part we will set up everything needed to perform automatic version bump from your local machine. \nOnce we are familiar with how it is done we will set up the GitHub action to create version in one click. \nLocal bump\nWhat are the steps we go through when creating releases manually ? \nIt probably looks somehow close to this: \n\nIncrement a version number in your package manifest (pom.xml, Package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod...)\nCreate a version commit: git commit -m \"chore(version): bump version to 1.1.0\"\nTag this commit: git tag 1.1.0\nPush everything to remote: git push\nOur continuous delivery pipeline detect the tag and perform the following:\n\nbuild some artifacts, create a GitHub release\nupload the artifact \n...\n\n\nMaybe bump the manifest with some pre-release metadata\n\nWhen using Conventional Commits and Cocogitto automating this is a piece of cake.\nExample\nTo demonstrate how it's done we will use pokemon-api, a toy\nproject made solely for demonstration purpose.\nWe don't really care about the actual code here,\nit is a Java project built with maven and that is all you need to know. \nThe first thing we need to do is to tell Cocogitto what we want to do before and after tagging the release.\nThis is done via the cog.toml config file : \npre_bump_hooks = [\n    \"\"\"\n        sh -c \"./ci/ensure_on_branch_main.sh\"\n    \"\"\",\n    \"mvn package -q\",\n    \"mvn versions:set -DnewVersion={{version}}\",\n]\n\npost_bump_hooks = [\n    \"git push\",\n    \"git push origin {{version}}\",\n]\n\nNote that we added a little shell script called ensure_on_branch_main.sh to verify we are not bumping from a feature\nbranch, it looks like this : \n#!/bin/sh\n\nCURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\n\nif [ \"$CURRENT_BRANCH\" != \"main\" ]\nthen\n    echo \"Needs to be on main to bump current version\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nLet us now review this config in detail:\n\npre_bump_hooks contains an array of shell commands to run before performing the release.\npost_bump_hooks are run after the release tag has been created. \nOn pre-hooks success, Cocogitto will generate a changelog, create a release commit, tag it and \nthen run the post-bump hooks. \n\nLet's examine the commands.\nPre-bumps:\n\nsh -c \"./ci/ensure_on_branch_main.sh\": ensure we are running the automatic bump on branch main.\nmvn package -q: build our project and run the tests. \nmvn versions:set -DnewVersion={{version}}: increment the package manifest. The {{version}} variable will be replaced\nwith our target version.\n\nPost-bumps:\n\ngit push: push the generated release commit to remote\ngit push origin {{version}}: push the generated tag to remote. \n\nWe are almost ready to release but there is one more thing we can do.\nCocogitto will generate a changelog during the release process, we need to tell \nit how to generate markdown links to commits, tags and GitHub users. \n[changelog]\n# The git platform our project is hosted on\nremote = \"github.com\"\n# The repository owner on GitHub\nowner = \"oknozor\"\n# The repository name on GitHub\nrepository = \"pokemon_api\"\n# One of Cocoggito built-in changelog template (possible values are \"simple\", \"full_hash\" and \"remote\"\ntemplate = \"remote\"\n# A list of commit authors with their git signature and GitHub username\nauthors = [\n    { signature = \"Paul Delafosse\", username = \"oknozor\" }\n]\n\nAlright we are ready now, let's take a look at our project git log before creating our first release : \n* 7403430 - (HEAD -&gt; main, origin/main) chore: Add changelog config in cog.toml\n* 809c029 - chore: Remove quarkus example default endpoint\n* d4930bf - feat: add automatic release config in cog.toml\n* 3d4874c - chore: Initial commit\n\nSince there is no version published yet, we should bump from 0.0.0 to 0.1.0 :\n❯ cog bump --auto                              \nFailed to get current version, falling back to 0.0.0\nSkipping irrelevant commits:\n        - chore: 2\n\nFound feature commit d4930b\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --------------------&lt; org.pokemon.api:pokemon-api &gt;---------------------\n[INFO] Building pokemon-api 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO] --------------------------------[ jar ]---------------------------------\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- versions-maven-plugin:2.8.1:set (default-cli) @ pokemon-api ---\nDownloading from central: https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/commons-collections/commons-collections/3.2/commons-collections-3.2.pom\nDownloaded from central: https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/commons-collections/commons-collections/3.2/commons-collections-3.2.pom (0 B at 0 B/s)\n...\n[INFO] Local aggregation root: /home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/pokemon_api\n[INFO] Processing change of org.pokemon.api:pokemon-api:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT -&gt; 0.1.0\n[INFO] Processing org.pokemon.api:pokemon-api\n[INFO]     Updating project org.pokemon.api:pokemon-api\n[INFO]         from version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT to 0.1.0\n[INFO] \n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time:  4.329 s\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-11-28T11:04:05+01:00\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnumerating objects: 6, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (6/6), done.\nDelta compression using up to 12 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (4/4), 817 bytes | 817.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.\nTo github.com:oknozor/pokemon-api.git\n   7403430..3f0829a  main -&gt; main\nTotal 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nTo github.com:oknozor/pokemon-api.git\n * [new tag]         0.1.0 -&gt; 0.1.0\nBumped version: ... -&gt; 0.1.0\ncog bump --auto  29.84s user 2.07s system 219% cpu 14.530 total\n\nAs you can see everything ran smoothly, we have our tag : \n* 3f0829a - (HEAD -&gt; main, tag: 0.1.0, origin/main) chore(version): 0.1.0\n\nAnd a changelog has be generated : \n\nFrom now on, we can repeat this indefinitely.

All you have to know for now is that Cocogitto has \ntwo binaries: \n\n\ncoco to create conventional commits like this.\n\n\n\ncog which allow you to create version automatically based on your conventional commit history.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot more to it, but this is beyond the scope of this post.\nFew weeks ago I created a GitHub action that downloads the binaries,\nverify your commit history compliance with the conventional commit specification. Additionally, the action allow you \nto automate releases. \nBefore that I was not too interested in reducing the size of the two binaries. \nNow that I use this mechanism an HTTP call is made on every push to the repos using cocogitto's GitHub action to \ndownload the binaries, perform the required checks and/or perform a release. Having the smallest possible binary \nis now a must to speed up all CI pipelines using Cocogitto.\nGetting started\nI had read some blog post about rust binary size optimization before, but never tried to actually do it. \nPrior to any optimization, the size of our binaries was the following: \n\ncoco: 5.1M \ncog: 5.7M \n\nOuch! About 11 Megabytes for two binary, that's a lot. In comparison, let us examine some first grade CLIs apps:\n\ngit 3.4M\nbat 4.6M\nrustup 8M\n\nFeature wise, cog and coco are way smaller than those tools. \nThere must be room for improvement !\nFortunately there are plenty of blog posts and rust books out there. I recommend reading the following article\nwhich describe the primary goals of cargo designs. It might not seem relevant yet, but it will \nbecome crystal clear by the end of this post:\n\n\"Cargo is not just a dependency manager, but Rust's primary workflow tool.\"\nFrom the Rust lang blog: predictable dependency management\n\nCargo optimizations\nI did some research and found a blog post by arusahni\nand the build configuration chapter\nin the rust performance book. \nLet's get to it !\nOptimization level\nCompile time optimization can be achieved by tweaking your Cargo.toml release profile.\nFor an exhaustive list of available option checkout the cargo reference.\nThe opt-level attribute control the level of optimization performed by rustc. \nAs stated in the Cargo book: \"It is recommended \nto experiment with different levels to find the right balance for your project. There may be surprising results, \nsuch as level 3 being slower than 2, or the \"s\" and \"z\" levels not being necessarily smaller. You may also want to \nreevaluate your settings over time as newer versions of rustc changes optimization behavior.\" \nBefore we start tweaking our Cargo.toml keep in mind that our goal is only to reduce the released binaries size. \nIn the process compile time might increase, unfortunately we can't have the cake and eat it too. That said, for the sake\nof information, we will still inspect the build time before and after optimizing the binaries size.\nTo do this we can run cargo build with the following flags : \ncargo +nightly build -Z timings --release\n\n\n\nRemember we started from the following sizes:\n\ncoco: 5.1M\ncog: 5.7M\n\nSo let us try those optimizations levels !\n\nLevel s:\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = \"s\"\n\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 5.3M\ncog: 5.9M\n\ns optimization level produce slightly heavier binaries, next ! \n\nLevel z:\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = \"z\"\n\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 5.5M\ncog: 6.2M\n\nThis is getting worse ! \n\nLevel 1:\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 9.4M\ncog: 12M\n\nNo way ! \n\nLevel 2:\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 5.1M\ncog: 5.7M\n\nOkay, this is the default optimization level.\n\nLevel 3:\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 5.1M\ncog: 5.7M\n\nExactly like level 2, we made no progress here... \n\nLet's jump to the next optimization flag, we might want to \nretry switching between 2 and 3 when other optimization will be set. \nLink time optimization\nThe link time optimization flag controls how the LLVM backend will try to optimize the binary. This comes at the cost \nof longer linking time. I don't really care about build time, so we can go for the full LTO which will perform optimization\nfor all crates used in the project.\n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 3\nlto = \"fat\"\n\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 3.0M\ncog: 3.8M\n\n\nHere we are ! We made some real improvement here. I did not measure compile time yet, but I did not notice a huge \ndifference either.\nNow let us try to switch to opt-level 2 again: \n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 2\nlto = \"fat\"\n\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 2.9M\ncog: 3.7M\n\n\nThis is even  better, I am going to stick to this and try the next optimization flag. \nCodegen unit\nThe codegen-units attribute controls how much of the crate will be compiled in parallel. \nThe more codegen units the less compile time will be. To reduce the binaries size we need the smallest possible\nvalue here: \n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 2\nlto = \"fat\"\ncodegen-units = 1\n\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 2.6M\ncog: 3.6M\n\n\nWe are getting there. Something puzzled me a bit though, the cargo book state that \"No LTO is performed if codegen \nunits is 1 or opt-level is 0.\". That does not seem to be true, I did some test removing lto = \"fat\" or setting\ncodegen-units = 2, in both scenario I ended up with much bigger binaries. I might need to ask on the Rust discord\nchannel to understand what is going on here. \nAnyway the binaries are getting smaller. \nNow let's take a look again at the cargo -Z timing report :\n\n\nAs you can see the build is already about 5 seconds longer than it was without any optimization. \nI can live with that ! \nDon't panic, abort\nCargo allow you to completely disable stack unwinding and simply abort on panic. \nIf you are not familiar with the concept of stack unwinding you could probably read \nthis blog post by Armin Ronacher. \nDisabling panic is probably not something I should do but since we are experimenting here, \nlet's be greedy and go all the way down ! \n\n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 3\nlto = true\ncodegen-units = 1\npanic = \"abort\"\n\nBinaries size:\n\ncoco: 2.6M\ncog: 3.3M\n\n\nWe went from a total of 11.8 Megabytes to 5.9 Megabytes and all of this without changing a single line of code. \nIt is already quite an improvement but there is more we can do. \nThe duplicate crate problem\nCargo is loved by rustaceans and acknowledged to be one of the best package manager out there, if not the best. \nI think the way cargo handle dependencies has a lot to do with it. I use java at work and even if I have much respect \nfor maven developers, considering the size of the ecosystem and the age of Java, maven\ndoes not match the predictability simplicity of cargo.\nI started to think about optimizing Cocogitto dependencies because of two things I did before:\n\nI moved the code responsible for the conventional\ncommits parsing to a dedicated crate (conventional_commit_parser).\nI created a fork of the abandoned spectral which I used to write fluent \nassertions in the Cocogitto test harness, It is called speculoos (yes like\nthe belgian spiced shortcrust biscuit)\n\nTurns out the parser crate was still using spectral, in the end my dev build contained both the assertion libraries\nwhich are almost identical but have different names. This was trivial to resolve. I just needed to update the\nparser to use my spectral fork, but I started to wonder: what if I have the dependencies foo = 1.0.0 and bar = 2.0.0\nin my project and foo depends on bar = 1.0.0 ? \nWell other package manager would fail in such situation, but cargo is clever, too clever I should say !\nStephen Coakley wrote an article describing \nprecisely what happen in such situation. To sum up, in cases where cargo is not able to select a unique version for a \ncrate in your project, it will use name mangling to make both versions\ncoexist. \nExample\nLet's now create a simple example to see what exactly is happening here and how it will impact our binary size. \nFirst we create the binary foo and the library bar: \n~/_Workshop/playground\n❯ cargo new --bin foo\n     Created binary (application) `foo` package\n\n~/_Workshop/playground\n❯ cargo new --lib bar\n     Created library `bar` package\n\nThen let us set the foo dependencies in Cargo.toml\n[dependencies]\nbar = { path = \"../bar\" }\nrand = \"0.8.4\"\n\nAnd make bar depend on an older version of rand:\n[dependencies]\nrand = \"0.7.0\"\n\nNow we write a dummy main function in foo: \nuse rand::Rng;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n    let number: f64 = rng.gen();\n    println!(\"A random number generated with rand 0.8.4: {}\", number);\n}\n\nNothing too complicated here but there is something interesting, we set the bar as a dependency \nbut did not actually use it. \nTo see what is happening here we will need some extra tools: \n\ncargo-depgraph: Creates dependency graphs for cargo projects using cargo metadata and graphviz.\ncargo-bloat: Find out what takes most of the space in your executable.\ncargo tree: A cargo subcommand that display a tree visualization of a dependency graph. \n\nWe will now get the dependency graph for foo: \nfoo on master 📦 v0.1.0 via ⚙️ v1.55.0 \n❯ cargo depgraph | dot -Tpng &gt; graph.png\n\nAs you can see below, we have two distinct versions of rand coexisting in the crate.\nIt's even worse than it seemed at first: those dependencies bring their own duplicate dependencies.\n\nNow let us run cargo-bloat and see what happens: \nfoo on master 📦 v0.1.0 via ⚙️ v1.55.0 \n❯ cargo bloat --crates --release \n   Compiling bar v0.1.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/playground/bar)\n   Compiling foo v0.1.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/playground/foo)\n    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.47s\n    Analyzing target/release/foo\n\nFile  .text     Size Crate\n6.0%  92.2% 204.5KiB std\n0.3%   4.0%   8.9KiB rand_chacha\n0.1%   0.9%   2.0KiB getrandom\n0.0%   0.7%   1.6KiB rand\n0.0%   0.1%     230B [Unknown]\n0.0%   0.1%     219B rand_core\n0.0%   0.1%     185B foo\n0.0%   0.0%      68B ppv_lite86\n6.5% 100.0% 221.9KiB .text section size, the file size is 3.3MiB\n\nNote: numbers above are a result of guesswork. They are not 100% correct and never will be.\n\nThis is strange, we cannot see the duplication here, maybe cargo-bloat does not take name mangling into account\nand merge the size of both rand versions in one line ? \nLet's try something different. We will actually add some code to bar and call it in foo: \nuse rand::Rng;\n\n/// Function in `bar`\npub fn random_f64() -&gt; f64 {\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n    rng.gen()\n}\n\nuse rand::Rng;\n\n// Foo's main function\nfn main() {\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n    let number: f64 = rng.gen();\n    println!(\"A random number generated with rand 0.8.4: {}\", number);\n\n    // Call to the `bar` crate\n    let number_from_bar = bar::random_f64();\n    println!(\"A random number generated with rand 0.7.0: {}\", number_from_bar);\n}\n\nOkay now foo actually uses bar, let us run cargo-bloat again: \nfoo on master 📦 v0.1.0 via ⚙️ v1.55.0 \n❯ cargo bloat --crates --release \n   Compiling foo v0.1.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/playground/foo)\n    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.33s\n    Analyzing target/release/foo\n\nFile  .text     Size Crate\n6.0%  87.0% 204.7KiB std\n0.5%   7.5%  17.8KiB rand_chacha\n0.1%   1.9%   4.4KiB getrandom\n0.1%   1.0%   2.4KiB rand\n0.0%   0.2%     551B bar\n0.0%   0.2%     438B rand_core\n0.0%   0.1%     273B foo\n0.0%   0.1%     230B [Unknown]\n0.0%   0.0%      68B ppv_lite86\n6.9% 100.0% 235.3KiB .text section size, the file size is 3.3MiB\n\nNote: numbers above are a result of guesswork. They are not 100% correct and never will be.\n\nDid you notice what happened ? \nWhen we were not using code from bar, rand_chacha took 8.9 KiB and about 4.0% of the total binary size. \nNow that we call the code it takes 17.8 KiB, 7.5% of the binary size. My guess is that rustc does not include\nunused dependencies in the final binary.\nOur first assumption was partially true: \n\ncargo-bloat does not take name mangling into account and merge the size of both rand versions, correct.\nBut our first binary  did not include both rand version because bar -&gt; rand 0.7.0 was not used. \n\nNow that we have successfully bloated our crate with two version of rand how do we solve this ? \nThe most obvious solution is to manually set foo and bar rand version to 0.8.4. \nThis, of course works, but is not the most efficient. On a real life application with a dozen of dependencies we might have\nmultiple crates needing the same dependencies, this would work only partially.\nExcept for rand, I own all the crates here. In a real life scenario I would not be able to select\nwhat version of a particular sub-dependency will be needed. \nCargo like composer and other package managers uses the semver specification to select dependencies. \nThis is our way out: SemVer defines a set of requirement that can be applied to a dependencies, these can be found \non the cargo reference. \nLet's try to change the foo dependencies, so cargo picks the same rand version as bar:\n[dependencies]\nbar = { path = \"../bar\" }\nrand = \"^0.7\" # caret requirement: &gt;=0.7.0, &lt;0.8.0\n\nLet us create a new dependency graph: \n\nHooray it is fixed !\nWe will try to apply this knowledge to a real life (part-time/hobby) project.\nRemoving cocogitto's duplicates\nBack to our project: this is not a foo/bar hello world example, and I am not sure if we will be able to apply what we just \nlearned. Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained!\nHere are the current dependencies and profile optimizations set in Cargo.toml : \n[profile.release]\nopt-level = 2\nlto = \"fat\"\ncodegen-units = 1\npanic = \"abort\"\n\n[dependencies]\ngit2 = { version = \"^0\", default-features = false, features = [] }\nanyhow = \"^1\"\ncolored = \"^2\"\nchrono = \"^0\"\nconfig = \"^0\"\nitertools = \"^0\"\nserde_derive = \"^1\"\nserde = \"^1\"\ntempfile = \"^3\"\nsemver = \"^0\"\nshell-words = \"^1\"\nwhich = \"^4\"\nlazy_static = \"^1\"\ntoml = \"^0\"\nstructopt = { version = \"^0\", optional = true }\nconventional_commit_parser = \"^0\"\n\n[dev-dependencies]\nassert_cmd = \"1.0.3\"\npredicates = \"1\"\nrand = \"0.7.3\"\nindoc = \"1.0.3\"\nspeculoos = \"0.7.0\"\n\nNow let us inspect duplicate crates : \n❯ cargo tree --duplicates \ngetrandom v0.1.16\n├── rand v0.7.3\n│   [dev-dependencies]\n│   └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n└── rand_core v0.5.1\n    ├── rand v0.7.3 (*)\n    └── rand_chacha v0.2.2\n        └── rand v0.7.3 (*)\n\ngetrandom v0.2.3\n└── rand_core v0.6.3\n    ├── rand v0.8.4\n    │   └── tempfile v3.2.0\n    │       └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n    └── rand_chacha v0.3.1\n        └── rand v0.8.4 (*)\n\nnum-traits v0.1.43\n└── serde-hjson v0.9.1\n    └── config v0.11.0\n        └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n\nnum-traits v0.2.14\n├── chrono v0.4.19\n│   └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n├── float-cmp v0.8.0\n│   └── predicates v1.0.8\n│       [dev-dependencies]\n│       └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n├── num v0.1.42\n│   └── speculoos v0.7.0\n│       [dev-dependencies]\n│       └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n├── num-bigint v0.1.44\n│   ├── num v0.1.42 (*)\n│   └── num-rational v0.1.42\n│       └── num v0.1.42 (*)\n├── num-complex v0.1.43\n│   └── num v0.1.42 (*)\n├── num-integer v0.1.44\n│   ├── chrono v0.4.19 (*)\n│   ├── num v0.1.42 (*)\n│   ├── num-bigint v0.1.44 (*)\n│   ├── num-iter v0.1.42\n│   │   └── num v0.1.42 (*)\n│   └── num-rational v0.1.42 (*)\n├── num-iter v0.1.42 (*)\n├── num-rational v0.1.42 (*)\n└── num-traits v0.1.43 (*)\n\npredicates v1.0.8 (*)\n\npredicates v2.0.2\n└── assert_cmd v1.0.8\n    [dev-dependencies]\n    └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n\nrand v0.4.6\n└── num-bigint v0.1.44 (*)\n\nrand v0.7.3 (*)\n\nrand v0.8.4 (*)\n\nrand_chacha v0.2.2 (*)\n\nrand_chacha v0.3.1 (*)\n\nrand_core v0.5.1 (*)\n\nrand_core v0.6.3 (*)\n\nserde v0.8.23\n└── serde-hjson v0.9.1 (*)\n\nserde v1.0.130\n├── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n├── config v0.11.0 (*)\n├── serde_json v1.0.67\n│   └── config v0.11.0 (*)\n└── toml v0.5.8\n    ├── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n    └── config v0.11.0 (*)\n\nDamn it! I expected some duplications but this is a lot. Multiple versions of serde, num-traits, and rand... \nHow to we solve this ? \nLet's not dive into tweaking the SemVer caret requirements, there is something we need to pay attention to : \nSome listed duplicates have the [dev-dependencies] profile. Actually having duplicates in our test/dev build is not\nsuch a big deal.\ncargo tree will have those filtered out :\n❯ cargo tree --duplicates -e=no-dev            \nnum-traits v0.1.43\n└── serde-hjson v0.9.1\n    └── config v0.11.0\n        └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n\nnum-traits v0.2.14\n├── chrono v0.4.19\n│   └── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n├── num-integer v0.1.44\n│   └── chrono v0.4.19 (*)\n└── num-traits v0.1.43 (*)\n\nserde v0.8.23\n└── serde-hjson v0.9.1 (*)\n\nserde v1.0.130\n├── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n├── config v0.11.0 (*)\n├── serde_json v1.0.67\n│   └── config v0.11.0 (*)\n└── toml v0.5.8\n    ├── cocogitto v3.0.0 (/home/okno/_Workshop/MyRepos/cocogitto)\n    └── config v0.11.0 (*)\n\nIt is not perfect but much better already. There is one more thing we can check before trying the SemVer approach.\nThe first obvious issue I see here is config 0.11.0 needing serde-hjson sub-crates which brings an older version\nof serde in scope. I have no idea what serde-hjson is. I might not need that at all. \nRemember cargo depgraph ? We will take a look at it outputs before going further: \ncargo depgraph --build-deps | dot -Tpng &gt; graph.png\n\n\n\nWell this is not pretty, but this is useful. The cargo-depgraph documentation \nstates the following : \"dotted lines = optional dependency (could be removed by disabling a cargo feature)\", serde-hjson is one of them.\nThe default config features are the following : toml, json, yaml, hjson, ini. Cocogitto configurations files\nare made of Toml only. Let us disable those and see how it goes : \nconfig = { version = \"^0\", default-features = false, features = [\"toml\"] }\n\nAnd run cargo tree again : \ncargo tree -d -e no-dev\n\nNo need to tweak SemVer requirement anymore, we cracked the case already ! \nHow did this affect our final binaries size ? \n\ncoco: 2.3M\ncog: 3.1M\n\nHeck yeah, still improving !\nI will not go through all dependencies features we can remove here. \nWe got a solid grasp at how this should be done. \nScraping the last bytes away\nI am not too comfortable with this, but if you want to carve out all possible bytes out of your Rust binary \nyou can use the unix program strip. strip remove symbols from the final \nbinary/objectfile.\nAccording to wikipedia objectfile symbols are \"metadata used for linking or debugging, including: information to resolve\nsymbolic cross-references between different modules, relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments,\nprogram symbols, debugging or profiling information. Other metadata may include the date and time of compilation,\nthe compiler name and version, and other identifying information.\"\nCargo has a debug attribute, which removes debugs symbols from the target binary, just like strip. \nI did not mention it before because I obtained no significant result using this attribute. My guess is\nthat rustc always keeps the debugs symbols of the standard library.\nstrip -S cog\nstrip -S coco\n\nAfter stripping, the naked binaries size are 1.5M for cog, and 1.1M for coco. \nI usually do not use emojis but 😲! \nSummary\nWe went through the following techniques to reduce our binaries size : \n\nTweak cargo release profile.\nRemove duplicated crates with SemVer requirement.\nRemove unused or duplicated crates with cargo dependency features. \nRemove objectfile metadata with strip.\n\nWe reduced the total size of our two binaries from 11.8 Megabytes to 2.6 Megabytes. This is a huge improvement but\nkeep in mind that we generally don't want to do this at all cost.\nRemoving panic unwind or increasing build time drastically might not be worth a couple megabytes. \nModern hard drives have more than enough memory to handle your big fat binary and network is fast. \nThat said, when it is possible, removing duplicate dependencies is always worth it.\n\nUseful tools :\ncargo-bloat\ncargo-tree\ncargo-deps\nReferences :\n\nPredictable dependency management\noptimizing-rust-binary-size\nThe rust performance book\nDon't panic\nthe cargo reference - profiles\nthe cargo reference - specifying-dependencies\nname mangling\nreddit/noob_question_why_are_rust_binaries_so_big\n\n","id":"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/optimize-rust-binary-size/","title":"Optimize Rust binaries size with cargo and Semver"},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/reverse-engineering-aoe2-part-1/":{"body":"Introduction\nIn this blog series I will share my Ao2DE reverse engineering journey. I will try my best\nto spare you all the boring details, hour of digging through AoE2 game data and abandoned github repository.\nPeople have been reverse engineering Ao2 for two decade, and I wouldn't be going anywhere \nif it was not standing on those giant shoulders.\nI won't go to deep in the actual implementation, but I will assume some basic coding knowledge along the articles.\nI will use the following languages/technologies: Rust, Java, Quarkus, Postgresql. \nThe work I am doing here will be shared on GitHub under the scout.gg organization.\nAt the moment most of our repositories are not ready to use and are still in private mode. We will release everything once\nwe are ready. Meanwhile, anyone wanting to contribute is more that welcome.\nMemories\nBefore going further I would like to share some reminiscence. \nI've been playing Age of Empires for two decades now. Actually Age of Empire I is the first game I ever played. \nIn 1998, we had no computer at home, so my father took me to is office from time to time to play AoE for a couple of hour. \nIn the early 2000s I used to play at one of my friend's home with his elder brother.\nWe were playing in separate rooms so no one can cheat looking at is opponent screen. \nLater during high school we organized 4vs4 AoE2 LANs with friends.\nI was in charge of settings up the network for everyone and bringing a cracked version\nof Ao2 the conquerors (don't tell Microsoft please). \nWe drank beer, smoked marijuana and spammed 14 playing the best game ever made. \nEvoking this memory fills me with nostalgia, and I am pretty sure most AoE2 players of my generation can relate.\nAge of Empires versions\nSince the first release of Age of Empires II in 1999 many extensions and new versions were published:\n\nThe conqueror: the first expansion pack release in 2000 \nHD Edition and its many addons (2013) \n\nThe Forgotten\nThe African Kingdoms\nRise of the Rajas\n\n\nDefinitive Edition\n\nLords of the West\nDawn of the Dukes\n\n\n\nAlong this blog post we will focus on the Definitive editions. Its the latest and most popular version. \nSiege Engineers\nOne day, my friend Alex told me he was working on an aoe2techtree clone.\nHe started this as a hobby project to learn a new javascript framework. I was quite interested and \nwhen he told me how hard it was for him to collect gamedata I started to look at aoe2techtree codes \nto understand where the data came from. \nTurns out there is developer collective dedicated to Age of Empire reverse engineers called Siege Engineer.\nThe amount of amazing project going on there is just incredible. Game record analysis, techtree, game replay, modding ...\nIt would take an entire book to list every Ao2 related project made by those people, \nyou can check their repositories here.\nAfter asking around where I could get the techtree data I found some usefull tools: \n\naoe2dat is a small C++ program to extract raw data from the game and convert\nthem to a giant json file (about 300Mb)\ngenieutils is the backend library for ao2dat, in charge of deserializing the binary file\ncontaining all the game data (we will talk about this later). \ngenie-rs a rewrite of genieutils in rust ❤️ (Doesn't support Definitive Edition yet).\n\nExploring the data\nThe age of Empire II De installation folder contain a file called empires2_x2_p1.dat, this is the grall of AoE2 reverse engineers. \nIt's a binary containing about every useful information on the game: unit stats, buildings, technologies, sound, sprite location etc.\nIf you are a linux user like me and installed the game via steam you can find this file in  $HOME\"/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/AoE2DE/resources/_common/dat/empires2_x2_p1.dat. \nExtracting data via aoe2dat\nI installed aoe2dat and followed the build instruction. \nAfter a bit of struggle with the needed library I manage to extract the game data: \n./aoe2dat \"$HOME\"/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/AoE2DE/resources/_common/dat/empires2_x2_p1.dat\n\naoe2dat create two file from the parsed binary: \n\nfull.json: A 258Mb json file containing all the game data\nunits_buildings_techs.json: A digest version of the full.json file containing only \nuseful information on techs, units and buildings.\n\n\t\"47\": {\n\t\t\"cost\": {\n\t\t\t\"wood\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"food\": 300,\n\t\t\t\"gold\": 200,\n\t\t\t\"stone\": 0\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"help_converter\":28047,\n\t\t\"language_file_name\":7047,\n\t\t\"language_file_help\":107047,\n\t\t\"name\":\"Chemistry\"\n\t},\n\nThe above sample represent the data for the Chemistry technology, \nIt is quite self-explanatory apart from the help_converter and languages fields, \nthese are actually mapping to some internationalized text in some other game files. \nGetting help texts\nGoing on with the chemistry example, here are the acual game data we are looking for:\n\nThis is a screenshot of the game with the help text displayed when hoovering chemistry on the techtree. \nTo find this value in the game files, we need to list files in \"$HOME\"/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/AoE2DE/resources\n❯ ls \"$HOME\"/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/AoE2DE/resources\nbr  _common  de  en  es  fr  hi  it  jp  ko  _launcher  ms  mx  _packages  ru  tr  tw  vi  zh\n\nNow let's explore english game content: \n❯ tree\"$HOME\"/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/AoE2DE/resources/en\nen\n├── campaign\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── movies\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;     ├── cm1.wmv\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;     ├── ... \n└── strings\n    ├── history\n    ├── ... \n    └── key-value\n        ├── key-value-modded-strings-utf8.txt\n        └── key-value-strings-utf8.txt\n\nThe data we are looking for are located in \"$HOME\"/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/AoE2DE/resources/en/strings/key-value/key-value-strings-utf8.txt.\nTaking a look at the file content we can see some numeric values mapping to a string content:\n1150 \"Victory!\"\n1151 \"Defeat!\"\n1152 \"was defeated\"\n1200 \"Ready\"\n1201 \"Computer\"\n1202 \"Empty\"\n1203 \"Loading\"\n\nNow we will look for value we previously got for Chemistry in the json file produced by aoe2dat (I am using the french text here to match with my installed game). \n7047:\n\"Chimie\"\n\n28047:\n\"Développer &lt;b&gt;Chimie&lt;b&gt; (&lt;cost&gt;) \\nLes unités à projectiles (excepté les unités à poudre à canon) gagnent \n+1 de force d'attaque. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; Nécessaire pour les unités poudre à canon (Canonnier à main, galion à canon, \ncanon à\\nbombarde, tour de bombarde).&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;\"\n\nIt's a match ! \n107047 does not seem to map to anything in the text helper file, after digging the language file and comparing with other technology and unit data I found out there is actually an offset to get some other usefull help text: 107047 - 99000 = 8047.\n8047:\n\"Développer Chimie (+1 d'attaque avec projectiles, excepté pour les unités à poudre à canon)\"\n\nHooray !

What is pop-launcher you may wonder ? Well let's take a look at the readme on the pop-launcher repository.\n\nModular IPC-based desktop launcher service, written in Rust. Desktop launchers may interface with this service via \nspawning the pop-launcher process and communicating to it via JSON IPC over the stdin and stdout pipes. The launcher \nservice will also spawn plugins found in plugin directories on demand, based on the queries sent to the service.\n\nIn short pop-launcher is a small protocol sending Json entries for an application launcher over stdout and receiving \nuser queries over stdin. The general idea is to provide a common backend for application launchers that implement the protocol. \nAs far as I know, there are only three frontend implementation out there: \n\npop-shell: the PopOs, keyboard-driven tiling window manager layer.\ncosmic-launcher: a gtk front-end for pop-launcher.\nOnagre: a general purpose application launcher for X and wayland.\n\nThroughout this tutorial I am going to use Onagre to test the plugin and provide example screenshots. There is a good \nreason for this, I am the author of Onagre so I am quite familiar with it. Also, the secret goal of this article is to trick\nyou into installing Onagre.\nPop-launcher plugins\nIf you are familiar with other linux application launcher such as rofi and wofi you might be used to write\nshell scripts to extend the launcher capabilities. A very basic example would be to write a script using the find\ncommand to search and list files using rofi. It's quite simple actually: the script takes the rofi user input as arguments\nand rofi display the script output. Dead simple and quite efficient. \nWhile the pop-launcher approach resemble the rofi one, it imposes a common interface for plugin implementors which \nmake the plugins easy to write and guarantee it would work regardless of the which frontend is used.\nAdditionally, pop-launcher provides a unified configuration format, which give the information to the frontend on how to \nuse the plugin: should it keep a history, what icon should be displayed, when should the plugin be activated etc.\nThis small set of constraint makes it really easy to write pop-launcher plugins that works just the same on any frontend\nimplementation. I strongly believe it as the potential to grow a wide ecosystem, something comparable to \nAlfred on macOS. If you don't know what I am talking about, take a look at \nthis list. \nBefore diving into the plugin implementation here is a small demo of pop-launcher capabilities:\n\n\n\nWhat are we going to build\nIt would be nice to have something we could actually use at the end of the tutorial so let's build a stackoverflow plugin. \nEvery year in the stackoverflow survey, Rust rates as the most loved language so let's give some love back to stackoverflow. \nJoke aside, even if you could write a plugin in any language \n(for instance I use the pass plugin written in Python), pop-launcher being\nwritten in Rust, it also provides some interfaces doing the heavy lifting for us. \nLet us sum up, we will build a plugin to browse stackoverflow posts, using rust. \nRequirements:\nBefore getting started make sure you have the following installed:\n\nrust.\nIDE integration for rust, either intellij-rust or rust-analyzer.\npop-launcher.\n\nGetting started\nAlright you are all setup ? First let's create a new rust project with cargo: \n❯ cargo new pop-launcher-stackoverflow\n     Created binary (application) `pop-launcher-stackoverflow` package\n\nYou can then open it in your editor of choice and add the following dependencies to Cargo.toml: \n[dependencies]\npop-launcher-toolkit = { git = \"https://github.com/pop-os/launcher\" }\ntokio = { version = \"1.18.2\", features = [\"rt\"] }\nureq = { version = \"2.4.0\", features = [\"json\"] }\nserde = { version = \"^1\", features = [\"derive\"] }\nanyhow = \"1.0.57\"\n\nLet me pause here and explain the above dependencies: \n\npop-launcher-toolkit:\nWe need it to use the provided plugin interface, this is not mandatory, \nbut it will greatly ease the implementation. First it will take care of IPC message passing and serealization for us, \nhandle the log format and brings all the pop-launcher messages structures in scope. \ntokio: internally pop-launcher uses the tokio runtime, so we need our plugin to start the runtime with the #[tokio::main]\nmacro, provided by the rt feature.\nureq: we are going to make some http requests to stackoverflow.\nserde: to deserialize the stackoverflow http responses.\n\nThe Stackoverflow API\nBefore going further, let's take a look at an example response from the \nstackoverflow REST API:\n{\n      \"tags\": [\n        \"java\",\n        \"maven\",\n        \"spring-boot\",\n        \"manifest\",\n        \"spring-boot-maven-plugin\"\n      ],\n      \"owner\": {\n        \"account_id\": 5457896,\n        \"reputation\": 2754,\n        \"user_id\": 4340793,\n        \"user_type\": \"registered\",\n        \"accept_rate\": 61,\n        \"profile_image\": \"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c078df4144343cdad824bb4637b807d?s=256&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG&amp;f=1\",\n        \"display_name\": \"JeyJ\",\n        \"link\": \"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4340793/jeyj\"\n      },\n      \"is_answered\": true,\n      \"view_count\": 79174,\n      \"accepted_answer_id\": 54867850,\n      \"answer_count\": 7,\n      \"score\": 61,\n      \"last_activity_date\": 1647362781,\n      \"creation_date\": 1551101209,\n      \"last_edit_date\": 1647292833,\n      \"question_id\": 54867295,\n      \"content_license\": \"CC BY-SA 4.0\",\n      \"link\": \"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54867295/springboot-no-main-manifest-attribute-maven\",\n      \"title\": \"SpringBoot no main manifest attribute (maven)\"\n    }\n\nTo keep things simple we are only going to display the post title its score and the link. \nLet's write the structs for deserialization: \n#[derive(Deserialize, Debug, PartialEq)]\nstruct StackOverFlowResponse {\n  items: Vec&lt;StackOverFlowPost&gt;,\n}\n\n#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]\nstruct StackOverFlowPost {\n    title: String,\n    score: i32,\n    link: String,\n}\n\nQuerying Stackoverflow from rust\nNow that we have the datastructures to hold the API response we can query it using the ureq crate.\nLet's approach this using the test driven development process. \nFirst we define a search_posts function, taking a string parameter and returning a StackOverFlowResponse. \nPop-launcher plugins doesn't need fancy error handling, so we are going to wrap the return type within anyhow::Result\nto easily propagate fallible statement with the ? operator.\nFinally, we omit the actual implementation and use the todo!() macro as a placeholder.\nThis macro is quite useful when using the TDD process, its equivalent to panic! but convey an intent of implementing\nthe functionality. \nfn search_posts(intitle: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;StackOverFlowResponse&gt; {\n  todo!()\n}\n\nNow that our API is defined let's write a test, pop-launcher currently display a maximum of height search results,\nso we are going to limit our stackoverflow response to that amount of post. \nFor readability, we use the speculoos crate which provides fluent test assertions\nvia the assert_that macro. \n#[test]\nfn should_get_posts_from_stackoverflow() {\n  let posts = search_posts(\"spring boot\");\n\n  assert_that!(posts)\n          .is_ok()\n          .map(|response| &amp;response.items)\n          .has_length(8);\n}\n\nWe can now run our test with cargo test, it should fail with the following output:\n---- test::should_get_posts_from_stackoverflow stdout ----\nthread 'test::should_get_posts_from_stackoverflow' panicked at 'not yet implemented', src/main.rs:17:1\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n\nWe can now implement the http call, calling ureq::get, passing the query parameter and calling the endpoint. \nfinally we need to convert our result to anyhow::Result.\nfn search_posts(intitle: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;StackOverFlowResponse&gt; {\n  let response = ureq::get(\"https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/search?\")\n          .query(\"page\", \"1\")\n          .query(\"pagesize\", \"8\")\n          .query(\"order\", \"desc\")\n          .query(\"sort\", \"activity\")\n          .query(\"site\", \"stackoverflow\")\n          .query(\"intitle\", &amp;format!(\"\\\"{intitle}\\\"\"))\n          .call()?;\n\n  response.into_json().map_err(Into::into)\n}\n\nLet's run cargo test again : \nrunning 1 test\ntest test::should_get_posts_from_stackoverflow ... ok\n\nHooray, we have some stackoverflow posts to display! \nWe can now move forward to the plugin implementation. \nThe PluginExt trait\nNow that we are able to query posts from stackoverflow, we need to store them in a struct that implement \nthe plugin functionalities. Luckily for us the pop-launcher-toolkit crate provides a helper trait\nwhich comes with default behaviors for our plugin. Default implementation includes logging, and running the plugin.\nAll we need to do is to implement the trait and call the run function to fire up our plugin. \nuse pop_launcher_toolkit::launcher::Indice;\nuse pop_launcher_toolkit::plugin_trait::{PluginExt, async_trait};\n\n#[derive(Default)]\nstruct StackOverflowPlugin {\n  items: Vec&lt;StackOverFlowPost&gt;,\n}\n\n#[async_trait]\nimpl PluginExt for StackOverflowPlugin {\n  fn name(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {\n    todo!()\n  }\n\n  async fn search(&amp;mut self, query: &amp;str) {\n    todo!()\n  }\n\n  async fn activate(&amp;mut self, id: Indice) {\n    todo!()\n  }\n}\n\nMany things are going on here. We declared a StackOverflowPlugin struct, which hold our search results\nand implemented the non default function provided by the PluginExt trait: name, search and activate. \nThis is the bare minimum required to write pop-launcher plugin. The trait exposes other functions that come with a \ndefault implementation, we will use some of them later on, but for now let's focus on those three.\nFinally, note that we need to decorate the impl declaration with the #[async_trait] macro. Currently, Rust\ndoes not allow async functions in traits, the macro attribute bypass this limitation.\nIf you want to take a look at the available function run cargo doc --open -p pop-launcher-toolkit to browse \nthe documentation locally. I strongly recommend to do so and take a look at the toolkit and PluginExt \ntrait documentation. This will come in handy later on.\nOk enough talking let's implement the plugin behavior. \nName:\nFirst our plugin needs to have a name. \nfn name(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {\n  \"stackoverflow\"\n}\n\nSearch: \nNow we need to define how it will respond to pop-launcher search queries.\nasync fn search(&amp;mut self, query: &amp;str) {\n  match query.strip_prefix(\"stk \") {\n    Some(query) =&gt; match search_posts(query) {\n      Ok(response) =&gt; self.items = response.items,\n      Err(err) =&gt; error!(\"Failed to get posts from stackoverflow: {err}\"),\n    },\n    None =&gt; {}\n  }\n\n  for (idx, post) in self.items.iter().enumerate() {\n    self.respond_with(PluginResponse::Append(PluginSearchResult {\n      id: idx as u32,\n      name: post.title.clone(),\n      description: post.link.clone(),\n      ..Default::default()\n    })).await\n  }\n\n  self.respond_with(PluginResponse::Finished).await\n}\n\nThe first step here is to strip out the query prefix \"stk \". Pop-launcher will only \ndispatch query to our plugin when it matches the regex defined in the plugin.ron config.\nFor now, we just assume this regex matches anything starting with \"stk \".\nThen we run the search_posts function with our query and store the result in the plugin struct.\nFinally , dispatch the response via stdout using the respond_with helper function.\nIf an error occurs during our http call let's just log that with the tracing::error! macro.\nPop-launcher expect any amount of PluginResponse::Append messages, followed by a\nPluginResponse::Finished, note that if we forgot to send the Finished message, the launcher will endlessly wait\nand never display our search results. \nIn the PluginSearchResult respond we use the post index as an identifier, which will be needed to activate the \nentry later on. We fill the name and description and leave the rest set to their default values as we don't need them\nyet. \nActivation:\nWhen pop-launcher request an item activation, we use the xdg_open helper function to open our stackoverflow link \nin the browser. Finally, we respond with PluginResponse::Close and we are done. \nuse pop_launcher_toolkit::plugins::xdg_open;\n\nasync fn activate(&amp;mut self, id: Indice) {\n  match self.items.get(id as usize) {\n    Some(post) =&gt; xdg_open(&amp;post.link),\n    None =&gt; error!(\"Failed to get post at index {id}\"),\n  }\n\n  self.respond_with(PluginResponse::Close).await;\n}\n\nRunning the plugin\nNow that we are done with the required implementation, the last step is to run our plugin.\n#[tokio::main(flavor = \"current_thread\")]\nasync fn main() {\n    let mut plugin = StackOverflowPlugin::default();\n    plugin.run().await\n}\n\nWe spawn the async tokio runtime on a single thread with #[tokio::main(flavor = \"current_thread\")]\nand then all we need to do is to initialize our plugin and call the default run function provided by the PluginExt\ntrait. \nBefore integrating this into our pop-launcher frontend we can test our plugin manually.\nSince the plugin use stdin to receive query and write search results back to stdout we can run it in a terminal\nand type our request. \nIn the example above we sent the {\"Search\": \"stk async trait\"} search request and activate the first item with\n{\"Activate\": 0}. This should open the stackoverflow post in new browser window:\n/usr/bin/cargo run --color=always --package pop-launcher-stackoverflow --bin pop-launcher-stackoverflow\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25s\n     Running `target/debug/pop-launcher-stackoverflow`\n{\"Search\": \"stk async trait\"}\n{\"Append\":{\"id\":0,\"name\":\"Future is not Send, only when from async Trait\",\"description\":\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72341910/future-is-not-send-only-when-from-async-trait\",\"keywords\":null,\"icon\":null,\"exec\":null,\"window\":null}}\n{\"Append\":{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"Surf dependency causes &amp;quot;cannot be shared between threads safely&amp;quot; error in previously compiling program with matrix_sdk and async-trait\",\"description\":\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71077261/surf-dependency-causes-cannot-be-shared-between-threads-safely-error-in-previo\",\"keywords\":null,\"icon\":null,\"exec\":null,\"window\":null}}\n{\"Append\":{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Generic async trait that returns the implemented Struct\",\"description\":\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70995999/generic-async-trait-that-returns-the-implemented-struct\",\"keywords\":null,\"icon\":null,\"exec\":null,\"window\":null}}\n{\"Append\":{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"Async trait methods with associated return type and dynamic dispatch\",\"description\":\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70713691/async-trait-methods-with-associated-return-type-and-dynamic-dispatch\",\"keywords\":null,\"icon\":null,\"exec\":null,\"window\":null}}\n\"Finished\"\n{\"Activate\": 0} \n\"Close\"\n\nInstalling the plugin\nTo make pop-launcher aware of our plugin we need to write a plugin.ron file and move that along with our plugin binary\nto the pop-launcher plugin directory. To do so, we will use just make the installation\nsetup reproducible. \nplugin.ron\nThis is our plugin configuration, note that we added the stackoverflow icon downloaded from the \nStack-Icons repository.\n(\n  name: \"StackoverFlow\",\n  description: \"Search Stackoverflow posts\",\n  bin: (\n    path: \"pop-launcher-stackoverflow\",\n  ),\n  icon: Name(\"stackoverflow\"),\n  query: (\n    isolate: true,\n    regex: \"^(stk )+\",\n    help: \"stk \",\n  )\n)\n\njustfile:\n#!/usr/bin/env just --justfile\n\ninstall:\n    cargo build --release\n    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/pop-launcher/plugins/stackoverflow\n    install -Dm0755 target/release/pop-launcher-stackoverflow ~/.local/share/pop-launcher/plugins/stackoverflow/pop-launcher-stackoverflow\n    install -Dm644 plugin.ron ~/.local/share/pop-launcher/plugins/stackoverflow/plugin.ron\n    sudo install -Dm644 LogoGlyph.svg /usr/share/pixmaps/stackoverflow.svg\n\nWe are all setup let run just install and our plugin should be available in pop-launcher. \nDebugging\nLet's test this with our pop-launcher frontend : \n\nStrange, I works but feels a bit slow, also the search result does not always match the query I was typing.\nLet's take a look at the plugin logs at ~/.local/state/pop-launcher/stackoverflow.log : \n.local/state/pop-launcher\n❯ tail -f stackoverflow.log\n2022-05-28T08:05:28.012486Z ERROR pop_launcher_stackoverflow: Failed to get posts from stackoverflow: \nhttps://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/search?page=1&amp;pagesize=8&amp;order=desc&amp;sort=activity&amp;site=stackoverflow&amp;intitle=\n: status code 400\n\nMhh, it seems we are sending a request with the intitle= parameter empty.\nLet's adjust the search function so it does not try to make empty queries : \nasync fn search(&amp;mut self, query: &amp;str) {\n  match query.strip_prefix(\"stk \") {\n    Some(query) if !query.is_empty() =&gt; match search_posts(query) {\n      Ok(response) =&gt; self.items = response.items,\n      Err(err) =&gt; error!(\"Failed to get posts from stackoverflow: {err}\"),\n    },\n    _ =&gt; {}\n  }\n\n  for (idx, post) in self.items.iter().enumerate() {\n    self.respond_with(PluginResponse::Append(PluginSearchResult {\n      id: idx as u32,\n      name: post.title.clone(),\n      description: post.link.clone(),\n      ..Default::default()\n    })).await\n  }\n\n  self.respond_with(PluginResponse::Finished).await\n}\n\nIt kinda works, but we still have to send an icon per entry, and it's overall quite slow.\nYou can take a look at the current implementation here: pop-launcher-stackoverflow/step1 \nBy now you should be able to write your own simple plugins.\nHowever, our stackoverflow plugin is far from being ready, let's now dive into more advanced stuff. \nAdvanced implementation\nOur main issue here is that we are getting our search results via HTTP which is very slow compared to plugins\ngetting their entries via the file system, or anything locally available on our machine really.\nMix that with async code and things get messy. Maybe you noticed, sometime the plugin will display result\nfrom a previous query instead of the current one. pop-launcher will read the last search result we sent but since our code\nruns asynchronously there is no guarantee http request will respond in the order they were issued.\nTo get thing right we need to make use of the interrupt mechanism provided by pop-launcher: prior to sending new\nsearch query, pop-launcher will send an interrupt signal. Upon receiving this signal we will cancel all ongoing requests\nexcept the current one.\nSending interrupts\nThis will require a bit of refactoring and if you are new to rust this is going to be somewhat challenging. \nPlease bear with me while we detail the implementation.\n\nbroadcasting the interrupt:\n\nEvery time we have a new search request we will need to pair it with a receiver listening for interruption requests. \nBecause of that we need a multi-consumer, multi-producer channel, aka tokio::sync::broadcast. \nFirst we need hold the channel in our plugin struct: \nstruct StackOverflowPlugin {\n    items: Vec&lt;StackOverFlowPost&gt;&gt;,\n    interrupt: broadcast::Sender&lt;()&gt;,\n}\n\nAnd then, dispatch the interruption request send by pop-launcher to our tokio tasks by overriding the\ninterrupt function in the PluginExt impl block.\n#[async_trait]\nimpl PluginExt for StackOverflowPlugin {\n// ...\n    async fn interrupt(&amp;mut self) {\n        // Notify the ongoing search tasks they need to interrupt\n        let _ = self.interrupt.send(());\n        // Clear the current search results\n        self.items.clear();\n        // Tell pop-launcher we are done\n        self.respond_with(PluginResponse::Finished).await;\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe select! macro\n\nTo implement the interrupt mechanism we will use the tokio select! macro, which allows waiting on multiple\nasync computations and returns when a single computation completes.\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    select! {\n        // Make our http call to stackoverflow\n        query_result = search_posts(&amp;query) =&gt; {\n            // Do something with our results\n        }\n\n        // Just return on interrupt request\n        Ok(()) = interrupt.recv() =&gt; {\n            // Do nothing\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nHere we spawn a tokio task selecting between either a completed search request or an interruption.\nThis is where thing gets a little complicated if you are not familiar rust ownership rules, lifetime and the\nborrow checker.\nLet's demonstrate the problem with a simple example: \n    async fn search(&amp;mut self, query: &amp;str) {\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            self.items = search_posts(query).unwrap().items;\n        });\n    }\n\nHere we tried to wrap our search function in a tokio task, so we can later implement the interruption mechanism.\nCompiling this will produce the following error: \nerror[E0759]: `self` has lifetime `'life0` but it needs to satisfy a `'static` lifetime requirement\n   --&gt; src/main.rs:22:26\n    |\n22  |     async fn search(&amp;mut self, query: &amp;str) {\n    |                          ^^^^ this data with lifetime `'life0`...\n23  |         tokio::spawn(async move {\n    |         ------------ ...is used and required to live as long as `'static` here\n    |\nnote: `'static` lifetime requirement introduced by this bound\n   --&gt; /home/okno/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/tokio-1.18.2/src/task/spawn.rs:127:28\n    |\n127 |         T: Future + Send + 'static,\n    |                            ^^^^^^^\n\nThe problem is that tokio task requires any values in its scope to live for the 'static lifetime. \nOur plugin struct is accessed via a mutable reference here, and we have no guarantee it will live long enough. \nWorst, even if we somehow managed to guarantee our plugin lifetime is valid, we would need to take multiple mutable \nreferences to our plugin struct (one per tokio task). This violates rust ownership rules.\n\nWrapping everything together:\n\nTo bypass these limitations we need to add an extra layer of message passing and ensure concurrent search results can be written \nin a thread safe way. To achieve this we will need a mutable thread-safe, reference-counting smart pointer aka Arc&lt;Mutex&gt;: \nstruct StackOverflowPlugin {\n    items: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Vec&lt;StackOverFlowPost&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n    search_tx: mpsc::Sender&lt;Vec&lt;StackOverFlowPost&gt;&gt;,\n    interrupt: broadcast::Sender&lt;()&gt;,\n}\n\nOur PluginExt::search function will now hold the search/interrupt logic : \n// ... \n\ntokio::spawn(async move {\n    select! {\n        query_result = search_posts(&amp;query, &amp;access_token) =&gt; {\n            match query_result {\n                Ok(query_result) =&gt; sender.send(query_result.items).await.expect(\"Failed to send query result\"),\n                Err(why) =&gt; error!(\"Failed to obtain query result from github: {why}\")\n            }\n        }\n\n        Ok(()) = interrupt.recv() =&gt; {\n            // Just return from this future\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nWe can now handle search results in a separate async task top get read of the lifetime limitation: \nasync fn dispatch_search_result(\n    search_rx: &amp;mut Receiver&lt;Vec&lt;StackOverFlowPost&gt;&gt;,\n    search_results: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;Vec&lt;StackOverFlowPost&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n) {\n    while let Some(new_results) = search_rx.recv().await {\n        // Wrap the mutex guard into a scope so we don't hold it across the async `send` method.\n        let plugin_responses: Vec&lt;PluginResponse&gt; = {\n            let mut search_results = search_results.lock().unwrap();\n            *search_results = new_results;\n\n            search_results\n                .iter()\n                .enumerate()\n                .map(|(idx, entry)| entry.to_plugin_response(idx as u32)) // Convert the entry to a PluginResponse\n                .collect()\n        };\n\n        // Dispatch messages to pop-launcher, notice we don't use the `respond_with` function since\n        // We are outside of the `PluginExt` implementor.\n        for search_result in plugin_responses {\n            send(&amp;mut tokio::io::stdout(), search_result).await;\n        }\n\n        send(&amp;mut tokio::io::stdout(), PluginResponse::Finished).await;\n    }\n}\n\nFinally, we need to update our main function: \n#[tokio::main(flavor = \"current_thread\")]\nasync fn main() {\n    // Our search results channel\n    let (search_tx, mut search_rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(8);\n    // The interrupt channel, notice we don't use the base receiver here. \n    // New receiver are created with the `subscribe` function.\n    let (interrupt, _) = broadcast::channel(8);\n    // Our thread safe, mutable smart pointer to the search results\n    let search_results = Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![]));\n\n    // Our plugin struct, now holding the interrupt broadcast sender, the search results sender and the \n    // search result pointer.\n    let mut plugin = StackOverflowPlugin {\n        items: Arc::clone(&amp;search_results),\n        search_tx,\n        interrupt,\n    };\n\n    // Last but not least, we use the `tokio::join!` macro to run our plugin \n    // And the dispatch task concurrently. \n    let _ = tokio::join!(\n        plugin.run(),\n        dispatch_search_result(&amp;mut search_rx, search_results)\n    );\n}\n\nThe final touch\nIf you followed the previous step carefully the plugin should now be working again.\nBut there are still few things we can improve: \n\nstackoverflow json responses sometime contains unescaped html characters.\ndisplaying urls in the search result description in not very useful, tags would probably be better.\nwe still don't have a main icon for our search results.\nStackoverflow API imposes request quotas for non-authenticated users.\n\nLet's first handle how we display the search results by adding the tags and is_answered\njson attributes.\n#[derive(Deserialize, Debug, PartialEq)]\nstruct StackOverFlowPost {\n    title: String,\n    score: i32,\n    link: String,\n    tags: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n    is_answered: bool,\n}\n\nI omitted the to_plugin_response implementation on purpose in the previous section. We will now implement it,\nso it displays the post tags, escape html characters with the htmlescape crate and use different\nicons for answered posts : \nimpl StackOverFlowPost {\n    fn tags(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        self.tags.join(\", \")\n    }\n\n    fn to_plugin_response(&amp;self, idx: u32) -&gt; PluginResponse {\n        PluginResponse::Append(PluginSearchResult {\n            id: idx as u32,\n            name: decode_html(&amp;self.title.clone()).expect(\"Decode error\").to_string(),\n            description: decode_html(&amp;self.tags()).expect(\"Decode error\").to_string(),\n            icon: if self.is_answered {\n                Some(IconSource::Name(Cow::Owned(\"emblem-checked\".to_string())))\n            } else {\n                Some(IconSource::Name(Cow::Owned(\"error\".to_string())))\n            },\n            ..Default::default()\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nFinally, we will add another config file to use a stackoverflow access_token. I won't explain the \ndetails here, but you can take a look at the final result: oknozor/pop-launcher-stackoverflow\n#[derive(Deserialize)]\nstruct PluginConfig {\n    access_token: String,\n}\n\npub fn access_token() -&gt; Result&lt;String&gt; {\n    let config = find(\"stackoverflow\")\n        .find(|path| path.exists())\n        .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!(\"'config.ron' config file not found for stackoverflow plugin\"));\n\n    let config = config?;\n    let config = std::fs::read_to_string(config)?;\n    let config: PluginConfig = ron::from_str(&amp;config)?;\n    Ok(config.access_token)\n}\n\nAnd it's done !\n\nConclusion\nAs we saw in the first part, creating a simple plugin is quite straight forward. \nHowever, things can get complicated if you enter the realm of concurrency and smart pointers.\nMost of the time plugins won't need this kind of  async shenanigans and if you feel overwhelmed by the \nRust async ecosystem you could still write your plugin with a more permissive language. \nIf something in this tutorial was unclear please don't hesitate to send a PR or to reach out on Twitter. \nI hope you are now going to implement your own plugins. \nPlease share your plugins on lucas-dclrcq/awesome-pop-launcher, \nwe maintain an exhaustive list of community plugins here, and we would be delighted to see the list grow. \nHappy coding !\n","id":"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/write-a-pop-launcher-plugin/","title":"Writing a stackoverflow plugin for pop-launcher"}},"docInfo":{"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/cocogitto-monorepository/":{"body":402,"title":3},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/how-to-lapce-plugin/":{"body":846,"title":4},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/one-click-away-from-release/":{"body":1441,"title":5},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/optimize-rust-binary-size/":{"body":2042,"title":6},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/reverse-engineering-aoe2-part-1/":{"body":656,"title":8},"https://oknozor.github.io/blog/write-a-pop-launcher-plugin/":{"body":2289,"title":5}},"length":7},"lang":"English"};
